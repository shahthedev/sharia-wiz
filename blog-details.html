          <h1 class="sub-title text-start mb-3">What is an Islamic Family Waqf ?</h1>
          <p class="blog-content">Many Muslim American couples have asked us to design a Sharia-compliant estate plan
            where
            the surviving spouse would manage their assets in trust,  and after they both pass, their waqf/trust
            assetswould be distributed to their  Islamic heirs. My Will collaborated with <a href="" class="">Azzad</a>,
             the premier award-winningSharia-compliant investment firm in the United States, to develop a family Trust
              that is valid underAmerican law, but – most importantly – also respects Islam’s rules for inheritance and 
            estate planning. We didthelegal research, consulted with Muslim scholars, and developed the first scholar-approved
            Islamic FamilyWaqf/Trust tofill this need in faith-based estate planning. The new Islamic Family Waqf helps families
             organize andmanagetheir assets, avoiding legal disputes and probate court, and creating avenues for the orderly
            distributionoffamily bequests and charitable giving.
            

            In a statement, Azzad said: “For years, our clients have struggled to find  authentic Islamic solutions
            to their estate planning problems. The Islamic Family Waqf we developed with My Will is the answer 
            to many of their prayers. We are pleased to be a part of this milestone in the Islamic
            financial and estate transfer space in the United States.”


            

            Abed Awad, CEO & Founder of My Will said: “The mission of My Will is to enable every Muslim American
            to makes faith-fulfilled estate plan and leave a legacy.The My Will and Azzad collaboration has made
            the process of making an Islamic Family Waqf simple,accessible,and affordable.”
