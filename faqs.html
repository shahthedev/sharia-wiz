                          <p>A Last Will and Testament is a legal declaration that you, the testator, make. It tells the world who will get your assets and who will manage your estate and implement your wishes when you die.
                            When you die without a Will – called dying “intestate” -- the state decides who gets your assets with no regard to your wishes and the needs of your heirs.
                        <br>
                        If you do not want state law to decide who gets your estate, use Shariawiz's software to prepare your own custom-tailored Shari'a-compliant estate plan valid for your state.
