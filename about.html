                <h3 class="section-title ">The Story of <span>My will</span></h3>
                <p class="text-center">The story of My will is the story of Islam in America. With the growing economic success of Muslim Americans, the next decade will witness the largest generational wealth transfer in our community. With this realization, Muslim Americans have struggled to find authentic Islamic solutions to their estate planning needs to support this historic generational transfer of wealth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the Sharī‘a as a methodology to produce knowledge and as a dynamic moral system, My will embarked on providing the faith-fulfilled solutions that Muslim Americans demand. After years of research and development by a team of lawyers, Sharī‘a experts, software engineers, and staff, including thousands of hours of testing and legal and Islamic law research, we launched My will.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since its launch in 2022, My will.com has released the first Sharia-compliant Islamic Family Waqf/Trust in the United States and was awarded "Best Innovative Halal Solution" at the Halal Expo and Summit 2022.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When you purchase a My will Islamic document, you are obtaining a document that has been built by an experienced legal and Sharī‘a expert team. Each My will estate plan is legally valid, state-specific, and custom-tailored by you. We want you to be comfortable and confident when you purchase a My will document. You get to review each document online before you complete your purchase and you can make alterations for life for no added cost. We also offer a 30-day money back guarantee.
